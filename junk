US-04 — Load prompt by section_id + version (reproducible resolution)

User story
As a Runtime, I want to resolve and load the correct prompt for a given section_id and version (or the section’s active/default version), so every run is reproducible and auditable.

Acceptance criteria

The system provides a single operation to resolve a prompt given:

section_id

optional version

If version is provided, the resolved prompt is exactly that version (no fallback).

If version is not provided, the system deterministically resolves the active/default version for that section_id.

The resolved result includes enough metadata to support auditability, at minimum:

section_id, version, and a stable prompt_id (or equivalent identifier)

Failures are explicit and distinguishable:

UNKNOWN_SECTION

VERSION_NOT_FOUND

BUNDLE_NOT_FOUND (or equivalent)

Error messages include: section_id, requested version (if any), and what the system tried to resolve.
