As a Compliance/Quality Owner, I want a single HIGH strictness policy profile to be defined in configuration and applied uniformly to every section run, so credit-analytics report generation is consistently safe, accurate, and auditable without code changes.

Acceptance criteria

A single policy profile = HIGH is defined in configuration (one source of truth).

Runtime loads and validates the policy profile before any LLM call; invalid/missing policy config fails fast with a clear error.

The HIGH policy profile is applied to every section execution (no per-section overrides).

Runtime records in run output/telemetry: policy_profile (HIGH) and a policy_version (or hash) for auditability.

Any policy violation is returned as a structured failure reason (e.g., POLICY_VIOLATION) and is logged consistently.
