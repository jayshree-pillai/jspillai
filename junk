Feature: Structured audit logs for every section run (repro + debugging)
This covers emitting an event per section run, consistent correlation_id end-to-end, success+failure coverage, and structured (not freeform) logging.

Scenario: Emit a structured event for every section run
Given a section run is started
When the section run completes (success or failure)
Then the system emits a structured log/event that includes at least: correlation_id, section_id, prompt_id, prompt_version, policy_version, model_id, latency_ms, tokens_in, tokens_out, and outcome

Scenario: Emit events on both success and failure (no silent drops)
Given a section run fails due to any error (including an uncaught exception)
When the failure occurs
Then the system still emits a structured log/event for that section run
And the event outcome is "FAILED"
And the event includes an error classification/code

Scenario: correlation_id is consistent across the entire execution path
Given a pack run is started and assigned correlation_id "corr-123"
When the system executes section "company_overview" within that run
Then logs/events emitted by CLI, runtime, LLM client, and telemetry for that section share correlation_id "corr-123"

Scenario: Logs are structured (machine-readable), not freeform strings
Given a section run produces logs
When I inspect the emitted logs/events
Then each log/event is machine-readable (JSON or key-value)
And required fields can be parsed without relying on string matching
