As a Prompt Engineer, I want each section_id to have a governed prompt bundle with required metadata and versioned prompt variants, so prompt changes are controlled and runs are reproducible without code changes.

Acceptance criteria

For every section_id, there exists a prompt bundle that contains:

Metadata describing the bundle (including section_id, owner, active_version, output_schema_ref)

One or more versioned prompt artifacts, each uniquely identified by a version

If a version is requested explicitly, the system uses that exact version.

If no version is provided, the system deterministically uses the bundle’s active version.

The system detects and rejects:

missing/invalid bundle metadata

an active_version that does not exist

duplicate/conflicting versions

Adding a new prompt version requires only adding a new versioned prompt artifact and (optionally) updating active_version—no code changes
