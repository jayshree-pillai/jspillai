US-05 — Run a pack (registry-driven) and assemble output

User story
As a user, I want to run a named pack (ordered section_ids) and get an assembled report, so I can generate a draft report in one command.

Acceptance criteria (tight, implementation-agnostic)

User can run: env + pack name (prompt version override optional).

System resolves every section_id via Section Registry (US-01) before running.

Unknown pack or unknown section_id ⇒ fail fast with a clear error (no LLM work starts).

Sections run in pack order; assembled report preserves that order.

End of run prints a short summary: success/fail per section + where outputs were written.

Default is fail-fast on first section failure; optional continue-on-error records failures and continues.

Overall run returns failure status if any section failed.
