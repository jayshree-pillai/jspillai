Feature: Section registry and binding validation
This covers discovering supported sections, resolving their bindings, and failing fast when registry/bindings are invalid.

Scenario: Lookup a registered section returns its bindings
Given the section registry contains an entry for section_id "company_overview" with a valid output schema reference and prompt bundle location
When I request the section spec for "company_overview"
Then the system returns the section spec containing section_id, output_schema_ref, and prompt_bundle_path

Scenario: Unknown section fails fast before any LLM call
Given the section registry does not contain an entry for section_id "unknown_section"
When I attempt to run section_id "unknown_section"
Then the system returns an "UNKNOWN_SECTION" error
And no LLM call is attempted

Scenario: Missing schema binding fails fast before any LLM call
Given the section registry contains an entry for section_id "company_overview"
And the referenced output schema cannot be resolved
When I attempt to resolve bindings for "company_overview"
Then the system returns a "SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND" error
And no LLM call is attempted

Scenario: Missing prompt bundle fails fast before any LLM call
Given the section registry contains an entry for section_id "company_overview"
And the referenced prompt bundle location cannot be resolved
When I attempt to resolve bindings for "company_overview"
Then the system returns a "PROMPT_BUNDLE_NOT_FOUND" error
And no LLM call is attempted

Scenario: List supported sections comes from the registry
Given the section registry contains enabled sections "company_overview" and "key_risks"
And the section registry contains a disabled section "experimental_section"
When I list supported sections
Then the result includes "company_overview" and "key_risks"
And the result does not include "experimental_section"
