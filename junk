As a Platform, I want a registry of supported section_ids with their schema binding(s) and prompt bundle reference, so the runtime can execute any section without hardcoding section-specific logic.

Acceptance criteria (implementation-agnostic)

The system maintains a single source of truth registry where each supported section_id is mapped to:

an output schema reference (and input schema reference if input validation is in scope)

a prompt bundle reference (location/identifier)

The runtime provides a standard way to resolve section_id → SectionSpec (the resolved spec includes at least section_id, schema ref(s), prompt bundle ref).

If a section_id is not registered, the run fails before any LLM call with a clear “unknown section” error.

When a registered section is resolved, the system performs a pre-flight integrity check that required references (schema + prompt bundle) are resolvable; otherwise it fails with a clear “missing/invalid reference” error before any LLM call.

A new section can be made runnable by adding registry entry + schema + prompt bundle, without changing the core orchestration pipeline.
