As a User, I want to define “packs” that specify which sections run, in what order, and with what defaults/overrides, so I can compose different report variants without changing code.

Acceptance criteria (implementation-agnostic)

The system supports named pack definitions that include:

an ordered list of section_ids to execute

optional pack-level defaults and/or per-section overrides (inputs, policies, model choice, etc.)

The runtime can execute a pack by name and will run sections in the declared order.

If a pack references an unknown/unregistered section_id, execution fails before any LLM calls with a clear “unknown section in pack” error.

A successful pack run returns a structured result that includes:

each section’s output keyed by section_id

run metadata sufficient to reproduce the run (e.g., which pack, which section versions/policies were applied)

Pack definitions can be added/edited to create new report variants without modifying core orchestration logic.
