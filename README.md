## 👋 Hi, I’m Jayshree Pillai — Machine Learning Engineer with a System Builder’s Mindset


Welcome to my portfolio.

I specialize in designing real-time machine learning pipelines with low-latency inference, robust retraining loops, and production-grade deployment on AWS.
My focus: end-to-end ML systems — from modeling and evaluation to infrastructure and observability.

Every project here reflects hands-on implementation across classification, regression, and NLP using tools like AWS SageMaker, Lambda, Kinesis, and Feature Store.

This GitHub isn’t for experiments. It’s a track record of deployed systems.

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Real-Time XGBoost Fraud Detection](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/real-time-xgb-fraud-detection)  
Full-stack fraud detection pipeline with streaming ingestion, low-latency inference (<300ms), and real-time alerting. Deployed via SageMaker, Kinesis, Lambda, and SQS/SNS.

### 🔹 [Real-Time NLP Complaint Classifier](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/real-time-nlp-complaint-classifier)  
DistilBERT fine-tuned on 129K+ financial complaints. End-to-end pipeline includes feature extraction, custom classifier head, SageMaker deployment, and Agentify-ready retraining hooks.

### 🔹 [Neural Network Fundamentals](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/neural-network-fundamentals)  
Forward pass, backprop, and gradient descent built from scratch in NumPy to validate internal mechanics — no frameworks, just math and control.

### 🔹 [Loan Default Classifier](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/cart-classification-loan-defaults)  
CART model using profit-based thresholds and SMOTE for imbalanced binary classification. Full EDA + evaluation strategy built in.

### 🔹 [Bike Rentals Demand Forecast](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/cart-regression-bike-rentals)  
Hourly demand prediction using XGBoost and feature-engineered weather + time variables. Hyperparameter tuning + error analysis included.

## 🧪 Currently Building

🎯 **Proprietary Trading Signal Engine**  
From-scratch alpha generation and strategy backtesting framework  
Focused on conditional filters, regime classification, and live execution logic  
Repo will be public once signal logic and guardrails are fully validated
