## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jayshree Pillai â€” Machine Learning Engineer with a System Builderâ€™s Mindset


Welcome to my portfolio.

I design and deploy **real-time ML systems** using the full AWS MLOps stack â€” SageMaker, Lambda, Kinesis, and Feature Store. With over a decade of engineering experience, Iâ€™ve transitioned from building trading infrastructure and risk pipelines to owning **end-to-end ML deployments** for high-stakes classification and regression systems.

This GitHub is not a playground. Itâ€™s a proof-of-execution.

## ðŸ”¥ Featured Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [Real-Time XGBoost Fraud Detection](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/real-time-xgb-fraud-detection)  
Full-stack fraud detection pipeline with streaming ingestion, low-latency inference (<300ms), and real-time alerting. Deployed via SageMaker, Kinesis, Lambda, and SQS/SNS.

### ðŸ”¹ [Real-Time NLP Complaint Classifier](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/real-time-nlp-complaint-classifier)  
DistilBERT fine-tuned on 129K+ financial complaints. End-to-end pipeline includes feature extraction, custom classifier head, SageMaker deployment, and Agentify-ready retraining hooks.

### ðŸ”¹ [Neural Network Fundamentals](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/neural-network-fundamentals)  
Forward pass, backprop, and gradient descent built from scratch in NumPy to validate internal mechanics â€” no frameworks, just math and control.

### ðŸ”¹ [Loan Default Classifier](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/cart-classification-loan-defaults)  
CART model using profit-based thresholds and SMOTE for imbalanced binary classification. Full EDA + evaluation strategy built in.

### ðŸ”¹ [Bike Rentals Demand Forecast](https://github.com/jayshree-pillai/cart-regression-bike-rentals)  
Hourly demand prediction using XGBoost and feature-engineered weather + time variables. Hyperparameter tuning + error analysis included.

## ðŸ§ª Currently Building

ðŸŽ¯ **Proprietary Trading Signal Engine**  
From-scratch alpha generation and strategy backtesting framework  
Focused on conditional filters, regime classification, and live execution logic  
Repo will be public once signal logic and guardrails are fully validated

Thanks for stopping by â€” I donâ€™t showcase experiments here, only validated systems. Always open to technical conversations and real-world ML opportunities.
