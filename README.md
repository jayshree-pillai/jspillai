Hi There! Welcome to my github repo - 

I am Jayshree Pillai,a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in production systems and a deep focus on real-time ML pipelines, MLOps, and applied modeling. I bring over a decade of software engineering experience and have recently built and deployed full-stack ML solutions using AWS SageMaker, Lambda, Kinesis, and Feature Store.

This repo serves as a landing page to showcase my key projects and ML portfolio. All work here reflects hands-on, end-to-end implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è In Progress

- Currently building out a **proprietary trading signal engine** from scratch ‚Äî focused on backtesting, alpha generation, and real-time strategy execution.  
- Code and detailed repo to be shared soon as I complete validation of core logic and risk filters.
